Wytchwood, Dredge

Movement, walking around from wytchwood: foraging game, exploration
A guy wants to create a potion  taking a lot of random stuff.
Maybe he has to fish (Dredge) and he has to keep his sanity 

### Situation of apocalypse
- The player is studying to become a wizard and he has a mentor. He was showing how to do some magics and The player breaks the division between humans and spirits. The spirits go inside the human world and in order to let them return to their world the player has to treat each of them based on what they need. 
The game purpose is to satisfy the spirits so they can go back to their world.

- The player breaks the division between humans and spirits. The spirits go inside the human world and in order to let them return to their world the player has to treat each of them based on what they need. 
The player is inside an environment and he moves inside of it in order to find the spirits, when he finds them he has to listen to what they want. One spirit for example could be hungry and need the player to find him food (for example with mechanics of fishing), one other could need the player to find specific rocks/plants, etc.
In this way the player can avoid the definite invasion of spirits in the world and by treating each spirit he can find the pieces of the map and be able to close the hole between the two worlds.
When a player finds a spirit he treats him with what he needs and then he has to do a challenge for taking a piece of the map. 

**Another interesting element could be:** put the spirits in the beginning of the game as the evils, so they are in the human world and they want to “eat you if they don’t find anything else”. But then, when the player is able to give them some other food and give them the possibility to go back to their world, the story “changes”: they are just there because of the hole, and they just want to survive.

**Other possible functionality:** Every spirit has his “little spirits”
